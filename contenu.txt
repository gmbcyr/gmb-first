The above layout is a page that divide horizitonally, for the left side , there is a list of textview and button , for the right side, there is an image view. The problem is: when the textview content is too long, the imageview will overlap the content of it, besides using bringtofront(), are there any way (in xml ) to resize the width of the text view if it overlap with image view?
